## Testing

Other Testing

- Responsiveness

- There was an issue with viewing the game pages in landscape mobile view.
> To fix this I used a body height of 100vh and a min-height of 100% for the page containers.

- HTML Validity
> index.html had issues with the a tag being a decendant of the button tag. Changed button tag to p tag. No errors other than this.
> the score and game html pages had an issue with the a tag being outside the li tag, so I put the a tag inside the li tag. No errors other than this.
> diamond.html had an issue with there being an empty h2 tag. I changed it to a div tag. No errors other than this.

- CSS Validity
> No errors in CSS files.

JavaScript

- Cleared localStorage to test if scores would update when localStorage was empty. There was an error due to null values preventing the code from displaying results.
> To fix this I wrote an if statement that would return from the forEach function if the value was null. 

- One of the images in club.js wasn't being shown. Console showed "ERR_BLOCKED_BY_CLIENT"
> After deleting, reuploading and renaming the file. The image now worked as intended.

- When testing, sometimes the XMLHttpRequest showed a 500 error in the console and stopped the game.
> I added in some error handling on each XMLHttpRequest throughout the project to display an alert to the user that an error had occured and to refresh the page.

- Contrast colours
> Used a11y contrast checker. No issues found throughout site.

- Code cleaned up
> Used prettier extension to clean up the code in all html, css and js files.

- Spelling

- Image sizes

- CSS autoprefixer
> Used autoprefixer on all CSS files. Copied updated code back into each CSS file.

### Project Barriers and Solutions

- There was an issue in club.js where because of where the shuffle rankings function was in the code and how the ranking index incremented, once you got to the end of the array, it would duplicate the same hand as the final question. This was because the rankings array was only shuffled once.
> To fix this I moved the shuffle ranking function out of the start game function, so that every question had a new shuffle.

- In spade.js I initially wrote the code for attributing the correct answers into the global displayhands function. But because of the nature of the API and having to use totally different personalised URLs for each request. This meant that this global function would have to be re-written for each question.
> To get around this I used object destructuring to attribute the correct answers in each question function, so that the global displayhands function would only have to be written once and could be used for each question.

- In spade.js because of how I used the API. This meant having to input my own chosen URLs. This also meant that being able to shuffle the questions for a better user experience was harder as each question came from a function and not my own created array.
> To get around this I had to put each question, which was a function itself, into an array. I got this help from stackoverflow.

- In spade.js I had issues with multiply shuffling.
> To get around this I added a reset function that reset each variable for the new question.

- I started my site layout with CSS grid, but I could quite manage to make the site look how I wanted it to, due to lack of experience using grid.
> I switched entirely to flexbox midway through as I am better using flexbox than grid. I realised I need to work on my grid css skills.

- Didn't like original homepage layout that is in the wireframe.
> Decided to place the four cards next to each other as I felt this looks better on desktop.

- Midway through I had issues with the modals due to using bootstrap as well as my own modals.
> I decided to completely remove all bootstrap from the project as I didnt need it and could write my own modals with js.

- Throughout the site there was issues with DOM manipulation and timing.
> I used the setTimeout function in certain places to help with better user experience.



- Trouble with API not loading sometimes.
